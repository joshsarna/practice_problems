Normally the search operation in an array looks for the first instance of a given value. But sometimes we may want to look for *every* instance of a given value. For example, say we want to count how many times the value "apple" is found inside an array. How many steps would it take to find all the "apples"? Give you answer in terms of N.

**N**

**The number of steps would be equal to the worst case scenario for a normal array search, since we would need to check every index. The difference is that it would take N steps every time rather than taking between 1 and N steps (for an array-based set it would still take between 1 and N steps, since finding one instance would be finding all instances).**
